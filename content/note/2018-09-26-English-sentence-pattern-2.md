## 例句
**I study hard every day**

【特点】第二基本句型以不及物动词为中心，表示主语在何种情况下**自身发出何种动作**。状语不是必备，但实际使用中通常带有状语。

**I work and study hard every day.**

**I get up at about 6:00 in the morning**

**I have stayed at the university for about three months.**

**I did not go anywhere except to class and the library.**

**Other students can sing well, dance well, but I can only sleep well.**
